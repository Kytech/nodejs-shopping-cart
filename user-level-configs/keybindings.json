// Here's some keybindings I like to use in relation to npm generated tasks.
// They're particularly useful for a workflow that uses the auto-attach feature
// I've organized these so that npm task shortcuts that I added are triggered by
// ctrl+alt+n followed by the first letter of the npm script to run.
// I also added a shortcut for the JS debug terminal using ctrl+alt+j.
// Copy these to your keybindings.json, which can be opened by pressing F1 followed
// by typing "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
